Universal compiling scripts for FRC

Installation instructions:
 - Add the "ucpp/ucpp" folder to your system PATH
 - Run the ucpp setup script with appropriate options for your platform
     Linux without WindRiver:
       $ ucpp setup linux-gccdist -i
     Linux with WindRiver, e.g. a dual-boot system:
       $ ucpp setup linux-windriver -c <path-to-c-drive>
     Windows using Cygwin:
       $ ucpp setup windows-cygwin
     Windows using MSYSgit command prompt:
       $ ucpp setup windows-git

Creating a project
 $ ucpp init -t <team-number>
        Configures the current directory as an FRC C++ project
        that deploys code to your team's robot.

        The ucpp build system aims to be fully compatible with
        development in WindRiver. You can initialize any existing
        WindRiver project as a ucpp project, as well as any folder
        that contains C++ files.

Building and deploying code
 $ ucpp configure
        Generates a Makefile for your project
        For additional options, run "ucpp configure help"
 $ make
        Compile the project
 $ make deploy
        Deploy code to the robot
